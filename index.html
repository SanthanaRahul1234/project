     <h3 class="heading">Climate change – Melting Ice Caps – what’s happening right now?</h3>
        <br>
        <hr class="header_line">
    <p>Polar ice caps are melting as global warming causes climate change. We lose Arctic sea ice at a rate of almost
        13% per decade, and over the past 30 years, the oldest and thickest ice in the Arctic has declined by a stunning
        95%. </p>
    <p>If emissions continue to rise unchecked, the Arctic could be ice-free in the summer by 2040 and the current
        state of melting on the Greenland Ice sheet is expected to double by the end of the century. Alarmingly, if all
        the ice on Greenland melted, it would raise global sea-levels by 20 feet. But what happens in the Arctic does
        not stay in the Arctic. Sea ice loss has far-reaching effects around the world. </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
    <h4>What specific Countries/Regions are most affected by the melting ice caps </h4>
    <p>Florida would disappear entirely along with most of Denmark, the Netherlands, Bangladesh, and many small
        island nations, some lower lying countries such as the UK and Uruguay would lose a significant proportion of
        their land area. </p>
    <p>According to the IPCC report, parts of London could also be submerged if the sea levels rise by more than
        two meters. Coastal and low-lying areas will be the most several affected, meaning large areas of the North
        East could also disappear if ice caps melt. </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
    <h4>How has melting ice caps affected humans? </h4>
        <br>
    <h5>How are humans affected by melting glaciers? </h5>
    <p>Sea level rise is perhaps the most serious impact. Coastal towns and cities face increasing storm surges
        and becoming permanently flooded. Alongside this, the loss of freshwater from glaciers means less to drink,
        to water crops, or to use in generating electricity. </p>
     <br>
    <h5>What are the social impacts of melting glaciers? </h5>
    <p>Glacial lake outburst floods will wash away people and infrastructure in the mountain slopes with more frequent
        floods (in the already fragile region) until around 2050, increasing river discharge. In the longer term, we
        will see persistent droughts with glacier-less mountains and water-less rivers </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
    <h4>How has it effected the environment? </h4>
        <br>
    <h5>What is affected by melting glaciers? </h5>
    <p>Loss of ice and melting permafrost spells trouble for polar bears, walruses, arctic foxes, snowy owls, reindeer,
        and many other species. As they are affected, so too are the other species that depend on them, in addition to
        people. </p>
        <br>
    <h5>How do glaciers affect the environment? </h5>
    <p>Glaciers act as reservoirs of water that persist through summer. Continual melt from glaciers contributes water
        to the ecosystem throughout dry months, creating perennial stream habitat and a water source for plants and
        animals. The cold runoff from glaciers also affects downstream water temperatures. </p>
        <br>
    <h5>How does melting glaciers affect wildlife? </h5>
    <p>Animals of the ice need sea ice to survive. Across the polar food web, sea ice loss and warming seas mean
        massive changes for them. Some are finding their food sources disappearing, some are losing habitat, and
        almost all are feeling disturbances to the patterns of their lives. </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
    <h4>How is it likely to change in the future </h4>
        <br>
    <h5>What will happen to Earth if glaciers melt? </h5>
    <p>There is still some uncertainty about the full volume of glaciers and ice caps on Earth, but if all of them
        were to melt, global sea level would rise approximately 70 meters (approximately 230 feet), flooding every
        coastal city on the planet. </p>
        <br>
    <h5>What is the future of glaciers? </h5>
    <p>Nearly half the world's mountain glaciers are expected to disappear by the end of this century, even if the
        world meets its most ambitious climate goals. A new study found that 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming
        would wipe out around 104,000 glaciers and raise global sea levels by about 3.5 inches in the process </p>
        <br>
        <hr>
    <h4>Can anything be done to reduce the impact of these changes? </h4>
        <br>
    <h5>What keeps glaciers from melting? </h5>
    <p>Realistically though, the only long-term solution is to slow—and eventually stop—the emission of greenhouse
        gases that drive an increase in global temperatures. Unfortunately, glaciers would continue to melt for decades
        even if global temperature is stabilized </p>
        <br>

        <h5>How can we prevent Antarctica from melting? </h5>
    <p>Moore of the University of Lapland, the research outlines a range of measures including building sea walls to
        block warm water, constructing physical supports to prevent the collapse of ice sheets as they melt, and
        drilling into ice to pump cooled brine to the base of a glacier. </p>

        <hr>
    <h5>What are underwater walls? – And how can they help stop the melting of ice caps? </h5>
    <p>To prevent the melting of glaciers, a team of scientists proposed an audacious plan: construct underwater walls
        that will either protect the ice from warm waters or support the ice. </p>
    <p>One of the scientists’ approaches involves using gravel or sand to make artificial mounds on the ocean floor
        that will help secure the glacier and hopefully let it re-grow. </p>
    <p>In another approach, an underwater wall will be constructed to stop warm waters from eating away the glacier’s
        base. Also, a wall of rock and sand placed at the glacier’s base would prevent the ice sheets from collapsing
        and sliding, and stop warm water from eroding the ice from the base. </p>
    <p>However, according to the team’s computer simulations, the more efficient design would be an incredibly tall
        and a miles-long wall or “manmade sill” that can serve as a constant barrier across the glacier’s length. This
        will provide the glacier with both protection from warm waters and physical support. </p>
    <p>Though the research authors said this strategy is presently beyond any engineering achievement humans have
        done. But it remains the most effective solution in preventing the melting of glaciers. </p>
